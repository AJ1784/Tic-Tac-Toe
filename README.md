Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Overview

This Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a Python-based implementation of the classic 3x3 grid game where two players, X and O, take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game can be played against an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm, making it an ideal choice for players looking to challenge themselves with an unbeatable computer opponent.

Features

Single-player Mode: Play against the computer, which uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
Dynamic Board Display: The board is printed after each move, showing the current game state.
Win/Draw Detection: The program detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
Move Validation: Ensures moves are made only in available spaces.
